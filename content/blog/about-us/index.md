# About the Coding to Learn and Create Project

{{< img src="images/designing-with-learners.png" alt="Designing with learner" >}}

The Coding to Learn and Create project is creating an [inclusive coding environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/) and [educational resources](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/) that empower all learners to express themselves using coding, art, and digital media. 

### Inclusive Coding Environment

Weâ€™re collaboratively designing an [inclusive coding environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/) with educators and students that will enable learners with complex disabilities to fully participate in educational coding activities. 

As we work on this environment, there are a few things we are keeping in mind:

* Make it easy and engaging to learn about programming concepts
* Let learners use our tool to tell stories, play, and express themselves on its own or pair it with popular, off-the-shelf robots
* Make sure its user interface is as accessible as possible

### Educational Resources 

We are also creating [educational resources](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/) that can be used as part of learning activities. These resources are created with the help of diverse communities in the form of [co-design sessions](/blog/co-design-session-1/).

If you would like to stay informed about our new software releases or co-design events then please [sign up for our newsletter](https://www.codelearncreate.org/#mc-embedded-subscribe-form)!
